Welcome to the Abyssinian Cat Classifier and Captioning Project! 🚀 This open-source initiative aims to develop robust machine learning models to classify Abyssinian cats 🐈 from images and generate captions describing their actions and features. Our goal is to create a high-quality, diverse dataset of cat images that can be used to train models to detect and describe Abyssinian cats accurately.

## 🌟✨ Meet Ruby, Our Muse 🐾🎉

Meet "Ruby," a dazzling Abyssinian cat 🐈 born on October 21, 2020, who has become the inspiration 💡 behind this project. Ruby is a female who absolutely adores people. Her eyes sparkle ✨ like rubies💎, which is how she got her name—not from the programming language, Ruby, mind you! (Just a little joke 😄).

Ruby is like a beloved little sister in our home 🏡, incredibly cute 🥰 and beautiful. It's our hope that many cat lovers ❤️ and owners will join and contribute to this project, sharing the joy 🎊 Ruby brings into our lives. If you're a cat enthusiast, let Ruby's story inspire you to participate 🙌 and help advance this project. Together, let's make this a fun 🎉 and fruitful 🍎 endeavor for all!

We believe that by sharing stories like Ruby's, we can create a community 🌐 that not only contributes to this project but also shares in the delight 🎈 of our feline friends.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- **📸 Data Collection:** Compile a comprehensive dataset of cat images, focusing on gathering over 1000 images for various predefined poses of Abyssinian cats.
- **🔍 Classification:** Develop a classifier that can accurately distinguish Abyssinian cats from other breeds.
- **📝 Captioning:** Implement a captioning model that can describe the features and behaviors of cats in images, with a focus on Abyssinian specific traits.
- **🚀 Performance Enhancement:** Improve the models' ability to detect and caption Abyssinian cats from low-resolution images and enhance the detection capabilities to recognize cats from as small pixel dimensions as feasible.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from cat enthusiasts, AI researchers, and developers. Here's how you can contribute:

1. **Data Collection:** Upload your cat images to the designated dataset folder. Ensure the images meet the quality standards outlined in our contribution guidelines.
2. **Model Development:** Contribute to developing and refining the classification and captioning models.
3. **Testing and Feedback:** Test the models and provide feedback on model accuracy and performance, especially in handling low-resolution images.
